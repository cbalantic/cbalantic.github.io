I received my PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources (January 2019). I'm currently working as a postdoctoral associate with the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Vermont/). As a doctoral student, I was a fellow in the [National Science Foundation IGERT Smart Grid program](http://www.igert.org/projects/281.html), through which I obtained UVM's [Complex Systems Certificate](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/certificate/). I love solving problems, writing, teaching, and coding. 

My main hobby is messing around on my guitar and piano (and trying to find people to harmonize with). I'm a former NCAA division I rower (captain, Cornell '09). After that, [I got into distance running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/67626184/statistics), and am hopeful that I can overcome the persistent injury I've battled for the past several years.
