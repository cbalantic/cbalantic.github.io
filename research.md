As part of my PhD and postdoctoral research at the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, we wrote an R package that supports remote monitoring of biodiversity in an adaptive framework (**AMMonitor**; available provisionally at [https://code.usgs.gov/vtcfwru/ammonitor](https://code.usgs.gov/vtcfwru/ammonitor)). 

**AMMonitor** encompasses data management, [automated detection of target species sounds using statistical learning algorithms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09524622.2019.1605309), [temporally adaptive audio sampling to maximize detection of focal species](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5579), a framework for [dynamic occupancy modeling using acoustic data](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1854), and a systematic workflow for tracking progress toward management objectives.
