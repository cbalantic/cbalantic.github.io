As part of my dissertation, I'm currently putting the finishing touches on an R package that supports long-term, landscape-scale semi-automated acoustic monitoring of wildlife (**AMMonitoR**; available soon!). It encompasses data management, automated species detection using statistical learning algorithms, temporal adaptive audio sampling to maximize detection of focal species, and a framework for dynamic occupancy modeling using acoustic data. Stay tuned for package release!
