I recently defended my PhD at the University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, and will be a January 2019 graduate. 

I'm part of the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Vermont/) and the [NSF IGERT Smart Grid program](https://www.uvm.edu/smartgrid/), through which I obtained UVM's [Complex Systems Certificate](http://www.vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/certificate/). You can read more about my research [here](https://cbalantic.github.io/research/). 

I'm a former NCAA division I rower (captain, Cornell '09). After that, [I got into distance running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/67626184/statistics), but have been mostly sidelined by a mysterious injury for the past several years. I'm a self-taught pianist and guitar player, and now that competitive-ish running is out of the picture, my main hobby is messing around on those instruments.
