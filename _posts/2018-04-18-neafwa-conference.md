Earlier this week, I shared some of my research at the annual [Northeast Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies (NEAFWA) conference](https://www.neafwa.org/). I had a blast talking with other attendees about the challenges of monitoring wildlife, and the opportunities (and additional challenges!) acoustic monitoring offers in this arena. My first presentation reviewed some of our work using [maching learning to minimize the number of false alarms](https://neafwa2018.sched.com/event/DxB5?iframe=no) automated detection systems can produce. My second presentation shared our approach to a [temporally-adaptive acoustic sampling scheme](https://neafwa2018.sched.com/event/DxC7?iframe=no) for situations with constraints on how much audio you can record.
