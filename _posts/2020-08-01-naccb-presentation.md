I'm sharing a recording of my recent presentation, [Toward a national perspective for climate change refugia conservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5vePzxy05I), which I presented at the 2020 North American Congress for Conservation Biology [(NACCB)](http://scbnorthamerica.org/index.php/naccb-2020/). This was an excellent event and I enjoyed getting to meet so many people virtually. Consider this an invitation to stay in touch (or get in touch!) if you are interested in any of this work.
