If you're interested in birds and bioacoustics, you're probably aware of [BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/), a bird sound recognition program developed by the [Cornell Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/). This is a promising free tool for processing a ton of audio data relatively quickly and understanding something about which avian species are present.

My challenge with BirdNET was actually *accessing* it. It was developed for Linux and Python users, and in my day job, I work on a Windows machine where I don't have admin rights. I'm also much more comfortable in R than I am in Python. After many failures, I have finally installed BirdNET on my Windows machine, and I'm now running it directly from RStudio. After all the frustration to install it, it was so worth the effort! I suspect BirdNET is going to be a game-changer for avian bioacoustics. I would not have been able to do this without helpful tips from a few particular colleagues. Thank you so much for your assistance, patience, and time.
