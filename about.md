Welcome! I'm currently an acoustic biologist with the National Park Service's [Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1050/index.htm).

I received my PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Vermont. I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Vermont), and later, the [Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center](https://necsc.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts.

Professionally, I love solving problems, writing, teaching, [coding](https://github.com/cbalantic/), and getting to do science that studies and supports our incredible network of public lands. Outside of work you can often find me playing guitar, birding by ear, hiking, and distance running on road or trail.
