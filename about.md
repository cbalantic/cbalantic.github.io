Welcome! I'm an ecologist specializing in bioacoustics. I received my PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Vermont. I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Vermont), and later, the [Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center](https://necsc.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts.

Professionally, I love solving problems, writing, teaching, [coding](https://github.com/cbalantic/), supporting research and learning opportunities for students, and getting to do science that studies and supports our precious network of public lands. Outside of work you can often find me playing guitar, birding by ear, hiking, and distance running on road or trail.
