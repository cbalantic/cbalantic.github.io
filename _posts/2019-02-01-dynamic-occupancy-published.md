title: "Dynamic wildlife occupancy models using automated acoustic monitoring data"

My first publication from my PhD work is out: [Dynamic wildlife occupancy models using automated acoustic monitoring data](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1854), published as an open access article in Ecological Applications.

It's a simulation paper informed heavily by our real field experience with acoustic monitoring. Our ultimate aim is to help automated wildlife monitoring methodology get to a place where it is easier to move from raw acoustic data to dynamic (multiple season) wildlife population models that have utility to land managers and decision-makers *through time*. There is a lot of interesting automated wildlife monitoring research coming out right now, from acoustic monitoring to camera trapping to drone work -- it's truly an exciting research space to be in. Hopefully this contribution helps push the field forward just that little bit more.
