I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center](https://necsc.umass.edu/) in the Department of Environmental Conservation at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.

I received my PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources (January 2019). Then I worked as a postdoctoral associate with the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Vermont/). As a doctoral student, I was a fellow in the [National Science Foundation IGERT Smart Grid program](http://www.igert.org/projects/281.html), through which I obtained UVM's [Complex Systems Certificate](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/certificate/). 

Professionally, I love solving problems, writing, teaching, [coding](https://github.com/cbalantic/), and getting to do science that studies and supports our incredible network of public lands in the U.S.

Outside of work, my main hobby is creating and playing music on my guitar and piano (and trying to find people to harmonize with). I'm a former NCAA division I rower (captain, Cornell '09). After that, [I got into distance running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/67626184/statistics), and am hopeful that I can overcome the persistent injury I've battled for the past several years.
