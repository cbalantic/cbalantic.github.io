I am an ecologist broadly interested in methods that support landscape-scale monitoring and management of prioritized natural resources, particularly on public lands. I have developed methodology for acoustic monitoring of wildlife, including modeling approaches, hardware, and software tools, and have also done research on climate change adaptation planning.

## Climate Change Adaptation Planning 
The [Refugia Research Coalition](https://www.climaterefugia.org/) provides an overview of what climate change refugia are and how they are being used as a climate adaptation tool. You can also view a recent [presentation on climate change refugia conservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5vePzxy05I) that I gave at [NACCB 2020](http://scbnorthamerica.org/index.php/naccb-2020/).

## Tools for Landscape-scale Remote Ecological Monitoring
As part of my PhD and postdoctoral research at the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, we wrote an R package that supports remote monitoring of biodiversity in an adaptive framework (**AMMonitor**; available provisionally at [https://code.usgs.gov/vtcfwru/ammonitor](https://code.usgs.gov/vtcfwru/ammonitor)). 

**AMMonitor** encompasses data management, [automated detection of target species sounds using statistical learning algorithms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09524622.2019.1605309), [temporally adaptive audio sampling to maximize detection of focal species](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5579), a framework for [dynamic occupancy modeling using acoustic data](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1854), and a systematic workflow for tracking progress toward management objectives.
