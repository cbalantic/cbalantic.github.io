I recently defended my PhD at the University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources. I'm currently working as a postdoctoral associate with the [Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Vermont/). You can read more about my research [here](https://cbalantic.github.io/research/). As a doctoral student, I was a fellow in the [NSF IGERT Smart Grid program](https://www.uvm.edu/smartgrid/), through which I obtained UVM's [Complex Systems Certificate](http://www.vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/certificate/). I love solving problems, writing, coding, and teaching. 

My main hobby is messing around on my guitar and piano (and trying to find people to harmonize with). I'm a former NCAA division I rower (captain, Cornell '09). After that, [I got into distance running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/67626184/statistics), and am hopeful that I can overcome the persistent injury I've battled for the past several years!
