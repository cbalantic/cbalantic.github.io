I'm a hobby musician, and in February 2020 I started performing at local open mics. That's all on pause for now, so I'm aiming to make the best of the coronavirus lockdown period by recording some songs and putting them out into the world. 

#### [My Youtube channel is here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKRx9_DGyNHBLFuJkiWNxA). 
In the spirit of mimicking real performing conditions, and because I don't love the "recording" aspect of music enough to be a perfectionist about it, most of these videos are one take. I have no interest in the tech side of music, so I'm doing what I can with a cheap laptop and my headphone mic. 

Here's a [virtual open mic livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33x4cHj9IvE) I participated in on 3/29/2020. I'm at 50:49 & 1:54:00, but check out the whole stream -- lots of talent!
