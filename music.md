I'm a hobby musician (guitar/piano/vocals). In February 2020, I finally worked up the courage to start performing at local open mics, in hopes of meeting other musicians to play/sing with. That's all on pause for now, so I'm aiming to make the best of the coronavirus lockdown period by recording some of my songs and putting them out into the world -- mostly as proof that I was here. Despite my bioacoustics background, I have no interest in the technology side of music, so I'll do the best I can with a cheap laptop and my headphone mic.

And here's a [virtual open mic livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33x4cHj9IvE) I participated in on 3/29/2020. I'm at 50:49 & 1:54:00, but check out the whole stream -- lots of talent!
