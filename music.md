**COMING SOON.**

I'm a self-taught hobby musician (guitar/piano/vocals). Until recently, I had only played at campfires, family reunions, and house parties with friends. In February 2020, I finally worked up the courage to start performing at local open mics, in hopes of meeting other musicians to play/sing with. That's all on pause for now, so I'm aiming to make the best of the coronavirus lockdown period by recording some of my songs and putting them out into the world -- mostly as proof that I was here. Despite my bioacoustics background, I have no interest in the technology side of music, so I'll do the best I can with a cheap laptop and my headphone mic.
